# basic-python
Some simply python scripts to complete a variety of tasks (see README), inspired by University of Michigan's Python For Everybody Coursera specialization. 

All credit to the University of Michigan!

I tried to use self-explanatory names. It's mostly just short snippets and examples of a variety of python basics and libraries.
